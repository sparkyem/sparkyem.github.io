    <p class="text">"As a teen entrepreneur in the Portland area, I’ve met so many teens who have a product or service to sell, but can’t figure out a way to expand. They get out-competed by their more established, older competitors, and are stuck selling to friends and family.

That’s why I started Spark. By creating a physical space for teen entrepreneurs to grow, we’re able to create an innovation experience like no other. The youth market is a place for teen entrepreneurs to meet each other, receive feedback, and find mentors and investors."-Kyler Wang, founder</p>
